# AngularAFP
An Angular project that displays a list of films from a local database, allowing users to search the list and add new films using information from an external API

## Getting Started
How do download, install and run the application

- clone the repository
- navigate to the project directory
- make your changes to the .cfg file in both client and server if you need to modify something or leave default
- to install all dependencies on both client and server ( specific instruction of the .md file of each project )
- start both client and server
- enjoy

## About
### Current version: Alpha 1.0

My idea for the project was to create a website for searching movies from a local database (the idea started from the fact that I have many movies on Blu-ray and DVD at home and I wanted to make a catalog) with a supporting API for searching for movies in case they are not present in the local database, and then adding them to it to expand the catalog. No authentication would be necessary since once the project for advanced training is finished, I would only use it locally, so I don't think I will implement it. Obviously, both a client (in Angular for the project) and a server need to be created (I need to see what is more convenient, but most likely Python or .NET).

### Movie Catalog
Probably this project will be moved from this repository to another one [here](https://github.com/KemonoBAT4/Movie-Catalog) with a better ui and a more sofisticated database
